Of course. Here is the translation:

### Dependencies

*   **`compio`**: Provides the async `sleep` function. If you want to run this on a different runtime, you can replace it with that runtime's `sleep` function.
*   **`futures-util`**: Provides the `Stream` and `FusedStream` traits.
*   **`pin-project-lite`**: A macro used for safe `Pin` projection.

### Implementation Principle

The core mechanism is to use a replaceable `Future` (named `pending_fut`) to delay a task.

*   **Listen and Reset**: The `Debouncer`'s `poll_next` method continuously pulls new items from the source stream. Each time a new item is pulled, it immediately creates an async task (`Future`) whose job is to "first `sleep(delay)`, then return the item." This new task then directly overwrites any previous task that might exist in the `pending_fut` field.

*   **Execute and Output**: If no new items arrive within the `delay` period, the task in `pending_fut` is not replaced. When `poll_next` is polled again, it drives this `Future`. Once the `sleep` is over, the `Future` completes and returns the item it holds. The `Debouncer` then yields this item as a result to the consumer.

In short, the arrival of a new item discards the old pending task. Only the delayed task corresponding to the very last item gets a chance to complete without interruption, which achieves the debounce effect.
